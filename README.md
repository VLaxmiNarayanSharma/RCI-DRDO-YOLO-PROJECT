# RCI-DRDO-YOLO-PROJECT
This study covers the full pipeline of YOLOv11 and YOLOv12 models for aerial target and PCB defect detection, including data prep, annotation conversion, training (nano to large variants), evaluation, export, and deployment. It compares YOLOv11 vs YOLOv12 on speed, precision, recall, and mAP.
